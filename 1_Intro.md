# Introduction 
- Alternative to JS (superset which means that TS extends JS)
- Allows us to use strict types
- Supports modern features (ES6+, such as arrow functions, let, const, etc.)
- Extra features (generics, interfaces, tuples, etc.)

## Setup 
- step-1: open terminal 
- step-2: use `npm install -g typescript`
